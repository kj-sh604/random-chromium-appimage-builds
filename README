You will need to provide a Chromium Snapshot for each .AppDir

Makefile exists for easy building but don't trust it. I don'tâ€¦ yet. It'll get there.

Links for said Chromium Snapshots are referenced in each .AppDir's `usr/bin/README` file. 

Just head to the link, download, and extract.

Run the Makefile with 
$ make 

(if you're courageous)


If you're sane, run each command on each line of the Makefile with caution
